In the extension, I didn't make any change to the grammar, I extended the program to improve the 
human-computer ineraction experience. 
First, I added some descriptions about the grammar of Turtle,and now, the extension program allows the following functions:
1. Users can choose to input a existing file.
2. Users can choose to write a new file by themselves according to the grammar, this file will then 
   input to the program. The program will pause when users are writing the new file and will continue
   when they input 0 in the terminal.
3. users can choose which kind of output they want after the file is input, there are 3 kind of output:
   one, directly output the picture to the screen after the input file is parsed and interpreted;
   two, output the picture to a txt file;
   three, output the picture to a ps and a pdf file.
